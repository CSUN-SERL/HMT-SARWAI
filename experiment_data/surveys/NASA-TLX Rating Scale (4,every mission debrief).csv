Mission Survey 1,"We are not only interested in assessing your performance but also the experiences you had during the different task conditions. In the most general sense we are examining the “workload"" you experienced. The factors that influence your experience of workload may come from the task itself, your feelings about your own performance, how much effort you put in, or the stress and frustration you felt.

The workload contributed by different task elements may change as you get more familiar with a task, perform easier or harder versions of it, or move from one task to another. Please read the descriptions of the scales carefully. If you have a question about any of the scales, please ask the Researcher about it.
